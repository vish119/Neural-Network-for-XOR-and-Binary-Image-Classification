# Neural-Network-for-XOR-and-Binary-Image-Classification
 This code has two parts:
  1) 1 hidden layer with 3 neuron neural network for classifying  XOR data. I have used gradient descent method  with regularization and momentum  for faster and efficient convergence.Tetsing Accuracy: 91%
  2)1 hidden layer with 100 neuron neural network for classifying  Binary Image data. I have used gradient descent method  with regularization and momentum  for faster and efficient convergence.Tetsing Accuracy: 85%
